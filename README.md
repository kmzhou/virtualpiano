Dear TA, 
Welcome to our online piano! We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we have!
To play the piano, the user presses keys on the keyboard which coorespond with a note on the piano. Each note plays as it is being pressed, and no longer. To make the user experience easier, we added a "how to play" button that pulls up a pop-up stating how to play.  Also, we added a "change background" button that, when clicked, changes the background to 8 different colorful locations. 
For our creative portion, we added a "show keyboard references" option that displays the coorespoding keyboard and piano keys on each note. These labels can be hidden later with the "hide keyboard references" button that appears when "show keyboard references" is clicked. Also, we added the option for users to play with clicking their mouse.  Instead of using the computer keyboard, users can use their mouse and click on notes to play them. Finally, we decided to add a "change volume" option below this piano. Depending on their mood and environment, users can adjust the volume of their music. The current volume is always displayed above this input. 
Overall, we used express.js and howler.js, two new applications of javascript, to make this piano.
Thank you so much for your time, and feel free to reach out to us with any questions.
Best, 
Sarah and Kathy
