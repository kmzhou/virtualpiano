# Virtual Piano
A virtual piano with two modes of playing: clicking on individual notes with the mouse or pressing keys on the keyboard mapped to notes on the piano. A web application built using Express.js and Howler.js. 

Each note on the keyboard is mapped to a specific key on the keyboard. When the user plays a note, whether through the mouse or the keyboard, the note will sound and be sustained until the user lifts their finger from the mousepad or the key, imitating the experience of a real piano.
